| GC Method                | Description                                                                                                                                                                         | Pros                                                                                                                                                                              | Cons                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Manual Memory Management | Memory is allocated and deallocated manually by the programmer using functions like `malloc` and `free`.                                                                           | - Full control over memory management.                                                                                                                                             | - Prone to memory leaks and dangling pointers if not handled properly.<br>- Difficult to manage complex memory structures and deal with concurrency issues.                        |
| Reference Counting       | Each object tracks the number of references pointing to it, and memory is deallocated when the reference count reaches zero.                                                       | - Immediate reclamation of memory when an object is no longer referenced.<br>- Can handle circular references.                                                                   | - Overhead of maintaining reference counts for each object.<br>- Inefficient for handling objects with a large number of references or in the presence of cycles.       |
| Mark and Sweep           | A two-phase process where reachable objects are marked and then memory occupied by unmarked (unreachable) objects is freed.                                                        | - Able to handle cycles and objects with complex interdependencies.<br>- Supports dynamic memory allocation.<br>- Suitable for long-lived objects and large heaps.                | - Requires a "stop-the-world" pause during the sweep phase, leading to temporary application unresponsiveness.<br>- Fragmentation may occur over time, affecting performance. |
| Generational GC          | Divides objects into different generations based on their age, and performs GC more frequently on younger generations. Older generations are collected less frequently.           | - Reduces the frequency of GC cycles by focusing on younger generations.<br>- Improves GC efficiency and reduces pause times.<br>- Suitable for workloads with generational object lifetimes. | - Requires additional bookkeeping to track object generations.<br>- Complexity increases with the number of generations.<br>- Can result in longer pauses for older generations. |
| Concurrent GC            | GC process runs concurrently with the application, reducing or eliminating "stop-the-world" pauses.                                                                                | - Minimizes application unresponsiveness.<br>- Better suited for latency-sensitive applications.                                                                                 | - Increased complexity in managing concurrent execution and synchronization.<br>- May introduce additional overhead and impact application performance.                   |

## Automatic Garbage Collection (GC)
This is the most common method where the language runtime automatically manages memory by periodically identifying and reclaiming unused memory (garbage) through various algorithms like mark-and-sweep, generational, or concurrent garbage collection.
## Manual Memory Management
In languages like C and C++, memory management is done explicitly by the programmer using functions like malloc() and free(). The programmer is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory manually.
## Reference Counting
This approach tracks the number of references to an object. When the count reaches zero, meaning no references exist, the memory associated with the object is automatically freed.

| Exceptions            | Exceptions are thrown when an error occurs, and can be caught and handled by appropriate catch blocks.                                                                   | - Separates error-handling code from normal code flow.<br>- Provides a centralized error handling mechanism.<br>- Allows for propagation of errors up the call stack.<br>- Cleaner code with less clutter. | - Exception handling can introduce overhead and impact performance.<br>- Requires additional language support.<br>- Exception handling can sometimes lead to less predictable program behavior if not handled correctly. |
| Result Types          | Functions return a result type that encapsulates both the value and the error, typically using tuples, structs, or specialized types like `std::pair` or `std::optional` in C++. | - Clearly communicates the possibility of errors.<br>- Avoids throwing exceptions and associated overhead.<br>- Forces explicit error handling.<br>- Allows for chaining multiple operations.     | - Requires careful checking of the result type to handle errors correctly.<br>- Increased complexity in managing the result type and error handling logic.<br>- Can make code less concise.                    |
| Assertions            | Assertions are used to check for conditions that are expected to be true.

| Logging               | Errors are logged to a designated logging system or file for later analysis or troubleshooting.                                                                          | - Provides a record of errors for analysis and debugging.<br>- Can be used for runtime monitoring and error reporting.<br>- Allows for different logging levels and configurations.             | - Logging may not be suitable for real-time error handling or immediate recovery.<br>- Requires an effective logging infrastructure and proper log analysis tools.<br>- May have performance overhead.          |
| panic/recover         | `panic` is used to indicate a run-time error, and `recover` is used to catch and handle a panic, allowing for graceful error recovery. | - Can be used in exceptional cases to handle unrecoverable errors.<br>- Allows for centralized error handling at higher levels.<br>- Powerful debugging tool. | - Should not be used for regular error handling.<br>- Can lead to uncontrolled program flow if misused.<br>- Can obscure error handling logic. |

## Exceptions
Many languages, including Java, C#, Python, and Ruby, use exceptions for error handling. Exceptions allow for structured and controlled handling of exceptional conditions. Errors can be raised (thrown) at one point and caught at a higher level in the program's execution stack.

## Return Values
In languages like C and Go, error handling is often done by returning error codes or error values from functions. The calling code checks the return value and handles the error condition accordingly.

## Error Flags/Status Codes
Some languages, such as C, use error flags or status codes to indicate errors. Functions return an error code or set a global error flag that the calling code can check to determine if an error occurred.

## Optional Types
Certain languages, like Swift and Kotlin, offer optional types. These types allow variables to hold either a value or a special "null" or "nil" value to indicate the absence of a value. Developers can use conditional checks to handle null values.

## Try/Catch Blocks
These blocks are used in languages with exception handling mechanisms. Code that might raise an exception is enclosed in a "try" block, and specific error-handling code is written in one or more "catch" blocks to handle specific types of exceptions.

## Panic/Recover
In Go, panic and recover mechanisms are used for error handling. A panic occurs when the program encounters an unexpected condition, and recover is used to capture and handle the panic by deferring it or logging the error.
