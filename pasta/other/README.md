# Memory Management / Garbage Collection Methods
## Automatic Garbage Collection (GC)
This is the most common method where the language runtime automatically manages memory by periodically identifying and reclaiming unused memory (garbage) through various algorithms like mark-and-sweep, generational, or concurrent garbage collection.
## Manual Memory Management
In languages like C and C++, memory management is done explicitly by the programmer using functions like malloc() and free(). The programmer is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory manually.
## Reference Counting
This approach tracks the number of references to an object. When the count reaches zero, meaning no references exist, the memory associated with the object is automatically freed.

# Error Handling Methods
## Exceptions
Many languages, including Java, C#, Python, and Ruby, use exceptions for error handling. Exceptions allow for structured and controlled handling of exceptional conditions. Errors can be raised (thrown) at one point and caught at a higher level in the program's execution stack.

## Return Values
In languages like C and Go, error handling is often done by returning error codes or error values from functions. The calling code checks the return value and handles the error condition accordingly.

## Error Flags/Status Codes
Some languages, such as C, use error flags or status codes to indicate errors. Functions return an error code or set a global error flag that the calling code can check to determine if an error occurred.

## Optional Types
Certain languages, like Swift and Kotlin, offer optional types. These types allow variables to hold either a value or a special "null" or "nil" value to indicate the absence of a value. Developers can use conditional checks to handle null values.

## Try/Catch Blocks
These blocks are used in languages with exception handling mechanisms. Code that might raise an exception is enclosed in a "try" block, and specific error-handling code is written in one or more "catch" blocks to handle specific types of exceptions.

## Panic/Recover
In Go, panic and recover mechanisms are used for error handling. A panic occurs when the program encounters an unexpected condition, and recover is used to capture and handle the panic by deferring it or logging the error.
